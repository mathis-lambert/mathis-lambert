## 🌟 About Me

Hello! I'm Mathis Lambert, an Engineering Student at CPE Lyon specializing in Computer Science and Network Communication. I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree (BUT) in Multimedia and Internet Professions, focusing on programming.

### 🚀 What I'm Up To

- **Personal Website Project**: I'm currently developing my personal website, which kicked off in February 2025. This project integrates various cutting-edge technologies, including LLM features, RAG knowledge usage, RESTful API, FastAPI (Python), and a frontend built with ViteJS, React, Redux, and Chakra UI. The backend is powered by FastAPI, and MongoDB is used for data storage.

- **R&D - AI/ML at Free Pro**: I'm part of the R&D team at Free Pro, where I work on innovative AI and machine learning projects. My role involves exploring generative AI models, fine-tuning transformers, and conducting research on open-source models like Mistral and Llama.

- **Certifications**: I've earned certifications in Backend Development with NodeJS and MongoDB, as well as JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures, totaling over 500 hours of specialized training.

### 🛠️ My Tech Stack

- **AI & Machine Learning**: Passionate about AI, machine learning, and data science. I work with transformer models, data-science datasets, and fine-tuning techniques like SFT, DPO, and LORA.

- **Programming**: Proficient in various programming languages and frameworks, including Python, JavaScript, and NodeJS.

- **Infrastructure**: Experienced in high-performance computing (HPC) with Nvidia H100 clusters, Docker, and slurm for managing tasks.

- **Networking**: Knowledgeable in 5G SA infrastructure, RAN, and GNodeB.

- **Computer Vision**: Skilled in OCR systems, DepthAI, and OpenCV for image processing and analysis.

### 🎓 Education
